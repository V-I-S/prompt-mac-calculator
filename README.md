Prompt presence notification, random access MAC strategies calculator.

Python 3 calculus library for communication probability success of `Bernoulli-Trials (BT)` & `tSlots` MAC[^1] random access strategies, developed in scope of the research of uncontrolled, distributed, no-ack MAC strategy in a slotted channel. Main point of the research was to derive all-nodes communication success probability formulas and compare performance for 2 fundamental approaches of no-ack communication.

# Calculator
This repository contains a source code of the calculus library helpful in determining the optimal configuration and performance of both analysed strategies (`BT` & `tSlots`), under given conditions. Please see `prompt_mac_calculator/api`.
